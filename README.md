### EML to GEXF converter 

This simple script bring a folder containig email file in a EML format, and 
convert the entire set of emails in a Dynamic GEXF file, ready to import in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) or similar product. 

I wrote this script in my free time for funny, so can be full of errors.  

I've tested it only with EML files exported from Outlook Office 365 for Windows.
Feel free to use this code as you want, and if you find a better way to do this operation please let me know, I'appreciate any suggestion.

Enjoy :)
